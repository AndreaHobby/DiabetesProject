# DiabetesProject

Objective
This is a project to analyze hospital readmission rates. 

### Step 1 Obtaining the data

Once the individual dataset was downloaded, I checked the variable types in **SAS 9.4**.
 
### Step 2 Data Cleaning and Manipulation 
 I checked for invalid character values and missing data. Then, I looked for out of range data. 
 I checked for invalid numeric values and missing data. I checked to see if any data types need to be converted. Last, I checked the range for variables. I looked for duplicates and values that are repeating. I checked that dates are correctly formatted. Relabel variables as needed. I dropped any unimportant variables. 

Creatd groups and new variables

#### Learned my data. 
Since this is healthcare utilization data, I wanted to learn the spread of the variables of interest that will be used in the model. 
I have created histogram that .... 

Also, I ran descriptive statistics for my variables of interest.
Mean/Medium/Mode and n for variables of interest
